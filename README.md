# Simple But Malicious

This repository contains scripts that are useful to understand how certain phishing techniques, encryption techniques, keylogging techniques, and other devious procedures are implemented programmatically. The examples contained herein are not production quality but do offer a small insight into how certain malicious tasks are accomplished with relatively little programming. Again, these examples are far from sophisticated and serve only as basic examples.
